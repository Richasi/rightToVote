The Exoplanet Expedition Planner is a web-based tool designed to assist in planning expeditions to explore newly discovered exoplanets. It allows users to select scientific instruments for the mission and calculates the optimal combination of instruments while adhering to payload and volume constraints.

Features
Select instruments from a list using checkboxes.
Dynamically updates the selected instruments and calculates total weight, volume, and scientific value.
Utilizes the knapsack problem algorithm for optimizing instrument selection.
Getting Started
